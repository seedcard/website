    <h1>Annex #1 - What is Cash?</h1>

    <p>Cash is a term used to describe physical currency, such as coins and banknotes, that is legal tender and used as a medium of exchange for goods and services. It is a widely accepted form of payment and is used in almost every country around the world.</p>

    <p>Cash refers to physical currency, which includes coins and paper money issued by a government or central bank. It is a tangible form of money that people use for everyday transactions.</p>

    <h2>Key Characteristics of Cash</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Physical Form:</strong> Unlike digital money or bank deposits, cash is a physical asset that can be held and exchanged directly between individuals.</li>
        <li><strong>Immediate Finality:</strong> Cash transactions are settled instantly. Once exchanged, the payment is final, without the need for any third-party verification, such as a bank or payment processor.</li>
        <li><strong>No Dependency on Technology:</strong> Cash doesn’t require electricity, internet, or electronic systems to function, making it usable in areas or situations where digital payment methods are unavailable.</li>
        <li><strong>Anonymity:</strong> Cash transactions offer a degree of privacy because they don’t leave a digital trail. Other forms of money, such as credit cards, bank transfers, or cryptocurrencies, are usually traceable.</li>
        <li><strong>Universal Acceptance:</strong> Cash is widely accepted and recognized in the issuing country. Other types of money, like checks or digital payments, may be limited by geographic or institutional factors.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>While cash has these distinct features, the rise of digital payment methods, credit cards, and cryptocurrencies has increased the use of other forms of money, but cash remains a fundamental medium of exchange.</p>
