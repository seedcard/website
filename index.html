    <h1>SEEDCARD</h1>
    <p>
        SEEDCARD is a physical Bitcoin key card designed to make gifting or transacting Bitcoin as easy as handing over cash, without requiring any technical knowledge.
    </p>

    <h2>How the SEEDCARD Works</h2>
    <p>
        SEEDCARD is based on the creation of two related pieces of information, called partial keys.
    </p>
    <p>
        These partial keys are generated using SEEDCARD Generator ECC open source software running on two Raspberry Pi SeedSigner devices, and engraved on two stainless steel plates using the Seed Hammer engraving machine.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Plate #1 - Proof of Work:</strong> The first steel plate, called the POW Plate, is engraved with the first partial key and is kept by the Card Issuer. Both plates are needed to recreate the full private key and recover the Bitcoin.</li>
        <li><strong>Plate #2 - Seed Card:</strong> The second steel plate, called the CIRC Plate, is engraved with the second partial key and can be used as digital cash. It has a Bitcoin public address and an NFC tag for verification and security.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        To spend the Bitcoin on the SEEDCARD, both the POW Plate (held by the issuer) and the Seed Card (held by the user) are required. The partial keys from the plates are combined via the Generator ECC software to create a full private key that grants access to the stored Bitcoin.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Use the SEEDCARD</h2>
    <p>
        The SEEDCARD holder scans the QR code engraved on the back of the card to verify that it's genuine, check the Bitcoin balance, or top-up the balance. However, to spend the Bitcoin, the card must be returned to the Card Issuer.
    </p>

    <h2>SEEDCARD Security Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Steel Plates:</strong> All important information is engraved on durable steel plates, making them resistant to fire, water, and physical damage.</li>
        <li><strong>NFC Verification:</strong> The built-in NFC tag makes it easy to verify the card without needing to reveal the engraved key. The UID tag is encoded during production and cannot be cloned or changed.</li>
        <li><strong>Offline and Secure:</strong> All key generation occurs offline using open-source software, ensuring no risk of online hacking or exposure.</li>
        <li><strong>No Technical Skills Needed:</strong> With SEEDCARD, users don’t need to understand Bitcoin’s technical details. Just scan, verify the balance, and make off-chain transactions as easily as using physical cash.</li>
    </ul>
